## Using the _ConnectorGenerator_ VSCode extension

### Create a new connector

#### From the command palette

1. Open the command palette by clicking on `View -> Command palette` or press `ctrl+shift+p` (`cmd+shift+p` on mac).
2. Search for `Create new HelloID connector project scaffolding`.
3. Select the connector type `target`.
4. Enter a name for the connector.
5. Browse to the location where you want the files to be created and press `enter`.

#### From the context menu

> Only available when a new file (can be of any type) is opened.

1. Right click to open the context menu.
2. Click on `ConnectorGenerator -> Create new HelloID connector project scaffolding`.
3. Select the connector type `target`.
4. Enter a name for the connector.
5. Browse to the location where you want the files to be created and press `enter`.

> The source connector templates are currently not available.

### Caching

When creating a new connector based of the template, the latest release will be downloaded from: https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-V2-Template/releases. The zip file will be unpacked and saved to in user folder using the latest release version as the folderName.

  - __Windows__: `C:\Users\<username>\<vscode-version>\extensions\connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache`
  - __macOS__: `~/.vscode/extensions/connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache`
  - __Linux__: `~/.vscode/extensions/connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache`

The latest will only be donwloaded in case the locally cached version is __older__ then the latest version available on GitHub.

### Code snippets

From version `1.2.0` Code snippets can be retrieved directly from the context menu: `ConnectorGenerator -> Retrieve code snippets` or from the command palette. Code snippets are retrieved from our [_helper_ repository on _GitHub_](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Lib-Prov-HelperFunctions/tree/main/PowerShell/Scripts) and cached locally in your user directory.

  - __Windows__: `C:\Users\<username>\<vscode-version>\extensions\connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache/snippets.json`
  - __macOS__: `~/.vscode/extensions/connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache/snippets.json`
  - __Linux__: `~/.vscode/extensions/connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache/snippets.json`

#### Using snippets

In order to use a code snippet:

1. Select a snippet from the list and click the arrow button to expand.
2. Click `Copy` to copy the snippet to the clipboard.

#### Updating the cache

The snippets cache can __only be updated manually__ by clicking: `Refresh snippet cache` from the status bar.

### Detecting variables holding sensitive information

To prevent uploading secrets _ConnectorGenerator_ actively scans for variables that might contain sensitive information. Potentially unsafe variables will marked _red_ to make them stand out.

To disable this feature:

1. Open the VSCode settings windows by clicking on: `ctrl + ,` or (`cmd + ,` on macOs).
2. Type: `connectorgenerator` to go to the section for this extension.
3. Make sure to toggle: `Enable Secret Scanning`.

### Highlighting HelloID specific variables

HelloID specific variables like `$actionContext` and `$outputContext` can be highlighted. Hovering above the variable will display an information window and containing the link to documentation.

To enable this feature:

1. Open the VSCode settings windows by clicking on: `ctrl + ,` or (`cmd + ,` on macOs).
2. Type: `connectorgenerator` to go to the section for this extension.
3. Make sure to toggle: `Enable HelloID variable highlight`.

### Advanded error diagnostics

With PowerShell, most __cmdlets__ write their output to the output stream. However, in HelloID this is not supported as all output should be written to the `$outputContext`. Therefore, __cmdlets__ like `Invoke-RestMethod` should always be assigned to a variable or outputted to `$null`. The _ConnectorGenerator_ checks __cmdlets__ for potential unwanted output in the output stream.

> Currently, this feature cannot be disabled.

### Adding connector templates files

From version `2.3.0` its possible to add connector templates files using the context menu allowing you to easy extend an already existing connector.

To add a template file:

1. In the __explorer__ window, click right to open the context menu.
2. Select `add connector template file`.
3. Select the template you wish to add.

> Missing folders will automatically be created!

### Change the FieldMapping systemGUID to the systemName

If you're fieldmapping uses account data from other systems, when exported, the JSON contains a _GUID_ instead of the system name. This will manually need to be resolved. To make this easier, the extension provides the option to change the _GUID_ to the system name.

1. In the __explorer__ window, select the `fieldMapping.json`.
2. Right to open the context menu.
3. Select `replace field mapping system name`.

![fieldMapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeroenBL/ConnectorGenerator/refs/heads/main/assets/fieldMapping.gif)

> Currently, only the `MicrosoftActiveDirectory` system name is supported.

### Development features

If you wish to extend or modify the template, you can do so by creating a new folder in the cache folder. Make sure the name of the new folder adheres to [semver](https://semver.org/).

To create a connector based of your updated version:

1. Open the VSCode settings windows by clicking on: `ctrl + ,` or (`cmd + ,` on macOs).
3. Type: `connectorgenerator` to go to the section for this extension.
2. Make sure to toggle: `Enable Version Selection For Development Purposes`.

This will enable two features:

- Quikly open the cache folder from the status bar by clicking on: `Open cache folder`.
- Option to select a template version when you create a new connector.

> Note that, with this feature `enabled` __new templates__ will __not__ be __downloaded__ from the GitHub repository. Instead, the __local cache__ is __always__ used as the __primary source__.
