### Caching

When creating a new connector based of the template, the latest release will be downloaded from: https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-V2-Template/releases. The zip file will be unpacked and saved to in user folder using the latest release version as the folderName.

  - __Windows__: `C:\Users\<username>\<vscode-version>\extensions\connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache`
  - __macOS__: `~/.vscode/extensions/connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache`
  - __Linux__: `~/.vscode/extensions/connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache`

The latest will only be donwloaded in case the locally cached version is __older__ then the latest version available on GitHub.

### Code snippets

From version `1.2.0` Code snippets can be retrieved directly from the context menu: `ConnectorGenerator -> Retrieve code snippets` or from the command palette. Code snippets are retrieved from our [_helper_ repository on _GitHub_](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Lib-Prov-HelperFunctions/tree/main/PowerShell/Scripts) and cached locally in your user directory.

  - __Windows__: `C:\Users\<username>\<vscode-version>\extensions\connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache/snippets.json`
  - __macOS__: `~/.vscode/extensions/connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache/snippets.json`
  - __Linux__: `~/.vscode/extensions/connectorteam.connectorgenerator-<version>/cache/snippets.json`

#### Using snippets

In order to use a code snippet:

1. Select a snippet from the list and click the arrow button to expand.
2. Click `Copy` to copy the snippet to the clipboard.

#### Updating the cache

The snippets cache can __only be updated manually__ by clicking: `Refresh snippet cache` from the status bar.
